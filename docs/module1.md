## Workshop Objectives

1. Standards-based approach
2. HTML-first development for faster velocity

## Why Enhance?

* Standards-based web development that can be used anywhere
* So why use the Enhance framework?
    * Building with components is nice
    * Server-side rendering is critical
    * Complex build toolchains and transpilation are a maintenance nightmare
    * HTML first is the fastest, simplest, and best way to build
    * Orchestrating all the other moving parts is hard (database, IAC, events, â€¦)
