* Did you have any problems?
* Can everyone run the begin CLI?

## Workshop Objectives

--
1. Standards-based approach

--
2. HTML-first development for faster velocity 

--
3. Use Custom Elements to build maintainable applications

--
4. Build and deploy a developer portfolio project


---
## Why Enhance?

--
* Standards-based web development that can be used anywhere 

--
* So why use the Enhance framework?

--
    * Building with components is nice

--
    * Server-side rendering is critical

--
    * Complex build toolchains and transpilation are a maintenance nightmare

--
    * HTML first is the fastest, simplest, and best way to build

--
    * Orchestrating all the other moving parts is hard (database, IAC, events, â€¦)
